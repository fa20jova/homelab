# Homelab Portfolio

This repository collects the configurations, diagrams, and scripts that power my homelab. It showcases my system administration and infrastructure engineering skills for prospective employers by demonstrating how I design, deploy, and operate services end to end.

## Technologies
- Kubernetes (workloads, namespaces, ingress, and service exposure)
- Longhorn (distributed storage and backups)
- MetalLB (bare-metal load balancing)
- Home Assistant (home automation and dashboards)
- Docker and Linux (container runtime and server management)
- PowerShell (Windows and infrastructure automation)
- Networking (FortiGate, Meraki, UniFi, VLANs, DHCP, and design documentation)

## Repository Layout
- diagrams/: Architecture and network diagrams
- kubernetes/: Cluster configuration and service manifests
- homeassistant/: Automations, dashboards, and blueprints
- Automation /: Automation for maintenance, backups, and monitoring
- networking/: Device configurations and network design references
